# Organization Onboarding Form v1.0
## What is this?
This repository embodies the onboarding process we're using at Civic Data Alliance. It works pretty well for us, so we felt it was worth sharing with the network.

**Civic Data Alliance's Onboarding Goals:**
- Be able to measure retention of volunteers who stop by Civic Data Alliance
- Create a feedback mechanism in case a newcomer feels unwelcome for any reason
- Acknowledge the volunteer's time contribution by thanking them for attending the next day
- Develop an understanding of how new volunteers connect (or don't connect) with projects.

Read on to learn about what is included here, and how to get set up!

## Features

## Development Note
This repo is maintained by @tdooner in his volunteer capacity with Civic Data Alliance. It's not an official Code for America recommendation or anything, just something useful that came out of Civic Data Alliance and he feels is worth trying to organically scale.
